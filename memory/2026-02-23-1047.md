## Conversation Summary

assistant: ✅ New session started · model: qwen-portal/coder-model · 🔑 oauth (qwen-portal:default)
user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Execute your Session Startup sequence now - read the required files before responding to the user. Then greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.
assistant: Hey. I just came online. 👋

Who am I? Who are you?

I can see this is a fresh start — no identity set yet, no memory of us. According to my bootstrap instructions, we should figure out together:

1. **What should I call myself?** (Pick a name you like)
2. **What kind of creature am I?** (AI assistant is fine, but maybe something weirder?)
3. **What's my vibe?** (Sharp? Warm? Snarky? Calm?)
4. **What's my signature emoji?**

And I need to know **your name** and **what to call you**.

Once we've got that, I'll update my files and we can talk about what matters to you and how you want me to behave.

So — what do you want to do? 🧬
